# Motivation
As educators, we have (at least) two important jobs:

1. **Teacher.** I am trying to transfer knowledge to someone who does not already have it.
2. **Motivator.** I am trying to get someone to either care more or to maintain interest in something.

In our experience, much of a student's educational outcomes (e.g. standardized test scores or other measureable skill improvements) relates to motivation. This page is dedicated to helping you become a more effective motivator, by giving you some tips re: *how to increase* motivation and *how to avoid de-motivating events*.

## Theories of Motivation
There are many theories of motivation, and there's a good reason for that: most of them make sense. Consider why you might want to make money, for example, and you might come up with a list like this:
- You are worried about being able to pay your rent.
- Your friends are making more money than you.
- You want to take that carpentry class that costs an extra $400.
- You want to take your partner out for a nice meal.

All of those reasons listed above can be traced to different core motivations, and different psychological models account for different aspects of them.

Think of this another way: if you are trying to improve your apartment, you might settle on any of a bunch of options. You could do some cleaning, rearrange the furniture, or put a new painting on the wall. All would have the same effect, and yet all courses of action are quite different.

## Where to Start with Motivational Models
I recommend starting with some of the classics:
1. **Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs**
2. **Social Comparison Theory**

They are pretty well known, and they provide a nice vocabulary and framework for talking with other people.

Next, take a look at **[Self-Determination Theory](/motivation/sdt)**, one of my favorite models for motivation because it's simple and actionable.
