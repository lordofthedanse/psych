    <h1 id="motivation">Motivation</h1>
<p>As educators, we have (at least) two important jobs:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Teacher.</strong> I am trying to transfer knowledge to someone who does not already have it.</li>
  <li><strong>Motivator.</strong> I am trying to get someone to either care more or to maintain interest in something.</li>
</ol>

<p>In our experience, much of a student’s educational outcomes (e.g. standardized test scores or other measureable skill improvements) relates to motivation. This page is dedicated to helping you become a more effective motivator, by giving you some tips re: <em>how to increase</em> motivation and <em>how to avoid de-motivating events</em>.</p>

<h2 id="theories-of-motivation">Theories of Motivation</h2>
<p>There are many theories of motivation, and there’s a good reason for that: most of them make sense. Consider why you might want to make money, for example, and you might come up with a list like this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You are worried about being able to pay your rent.</li>
  <li>Your friends are making more money than you.</li>
  <li>You want to take that carpentry class that costs an extra $400.</li>
  <li>You want to take your partner out for a nice meal.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of those reasons listed above can be traced to different core motivations, and different psychological models account for different aspects of them.</p>

<p>Think of this another way: if you are trying to improve your apartment, you might settle on any of a bunch of options. You could do some cleaning, rearrange the furniture, or put a new painting on the wall. All would have the same effect, and yet all courses of action are quite different.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-start-with-motivational-models">Where to Start with Motivational Models</h2>
<p>I recommend starting with some of the classics:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Social Comparison Theory</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>They are pretty well known, and they provide a nice vocabulary and framework for talking with other people.</p>

<p>Next, take a look at <strong><a href="/motivation/sdt">Self-Determination Theory</a></strong>, one of my favorite models for motivation because it’s simple and actionable.</p>
