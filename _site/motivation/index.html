    <h1 id="motivation">Motivation</h1>
<p>As educators, we have (at least) two important jobs:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Teacher.</strong> I am trying to transfer knowledge to someone who does not already have it.</li>
  <li><strong>Motivator.</strong> I am trying to get someone to either care more or to maintain interest in something.</li>
</ol>

<p>In our experience, much of a student’s educational outcomes (e.g. standardized test scores or other measureable skill improvements) relates to motivation. This page is dedicated to helping you become a more effective motivator, by giving you some tips re: <em>how to increase</em> motivation and <em>how to avoid de-motivating events</em>.</p>

<h2 id="self-determination-theory-sdt">Self-Determination Theory (SDT)</h2>
<p>We find it very true that “success breeds success”, by which we mean when students are doing well (in their opinion), they tend to improve upon</p>

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Self-determination theory is a psychological theory of what motivates human behavior. It assumes free will (yes, that is an assumption for those of you not familiar with that realm of philosophy), but it assumes that motivation is impacted by three factors:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Competency.</strong> The proficiency I have for the skill required for <em>the thing at hand</em> directly impacts my motivation. In other words, if I speak French poorly, I will be less motivated to speak French with a waiter. Conversely, if I regularly raise my hand give correct answers … well, I’ll probably continue doing that.
Think: <strong>confidence breeds competence</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Relevance.</strong> If I understand how Task A is related to reaching some goal or value I have, then I am much more inclined to tackle Task A. This is a challenge for many students because someone is often <em>forcing</em> them to do things. Our challenge, then, is to:
    <ul>
      <li>Identify what students really care about (their goals, their values)</li>
      <li>Demonstrate the importance of Task A (e.g. completing homework; learning geometry) in reaching those goals.
One common problem we face at Occam is getting students to take authentic practice tests. Practice exams are not a common feature of standardized test preparation in Russia (where many of our clients are), and most students don’t initially understand why it is important to take 3+ hour practice exams on Saturday at 8am. When we explain that their test scores are a reflection of <em>their 3-hour performance at 8am on Saturday</em> and not a reflection of their knowledgeability, this makes sense with most (never underestimate the power of delusion).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Autonomy.</strong> If I <em>feel I am choosing</em> to do something, then I am more motivated. This relates to the notion of taking ownership. Students not familiar with the US application process normally wonder why they need to complete AP exams (especially if they are unrelated to their field of study). We normally address this by:
    <ul>
      <li>Explaining the relevance of AP exams (they are de facto required for competitive U.S. admissions, and they can help you earn advanced credit or placement that creates flexibility for you later when choosing majors, minors, courses)</li>
      <li>Having students participate in the AP course selection process (we allow them to make choices while giving them expert information they are not aware of: <em>taking AP World History alongside IB History is a bit redundant; it would be better to take another course</em>)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="so--how-can-i-use-sdt-with-my-students">So … how can I use SDT with my students?</h3>
<p>Knowledge is power. Re-read the above a few times a year until it becomes automatic to think <em>competence</em>, <em>autonomy</em> and <em>relevance</em> (<strong>CAR</strong> is the acronym).</p>

<p>After you know the <em>what</em>, the focus becomes the <em>how</em>, and — as with most teaching — planning and preparation are 80% of the battle.</p>
<ol>
  <li>If you are working with individual students,</li>
</ol>

<p>So let’s say, you’re either in the middle of a pickle, or despite your best planning efforts, some activity has falled flat. You might need to be a little bit of a diagnostician, but you can still use SDT to help get performance back on track:
If Kiddo X is demonstrating an obvious lack of motivation, I need to figure out why:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Do I sense the kiddo can reach the goal they set for themselves? If not, there’s a competence problem.</li>
  <li>Can the kiddo explain to me <em>why</em> the thing we are doing is important? If not, relevance problem.</li>
  <li>When the above fail, I will look to</li>
</ul>
