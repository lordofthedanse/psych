## Welcome

This is a collection of psychology resources assembled by Occam Education. The materials are relevants for teachers and tutors, and though none of the resources or materials assembled are harmful for students, they are bound to be more useful for adolescents and adults than younger (< 13 years) students.

These resources have been assembled because they work. We use and have used them with our students since 2008, and much of it is informed by research in fields that are now popular in positive psychology.

If you want are interested in learning more about these resources or the services we offer, feel free to [send us an email](mailto:info@occameducation.com).
